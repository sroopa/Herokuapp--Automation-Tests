# Herokuapp--Automation-Tests
Tools: Selenium Wbdriver. VisualStudio 2022, IntelliJ Idea
Challenges found while automating the application

1.	Dynamic elements â€“ Since the buttons, links, table or canvas has no unique locators.
2.	The labels on the button change randomly
3.	The dynamic text on the canvas was a new concept for me
4.	The edit and delete buttons with no functionality in place.
